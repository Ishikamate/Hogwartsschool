    <p>There were a variety of subjects taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. These included both the core curriculum and the electives, available from third year forward. In the fifth year, students take the Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) exams to determine whether they can achieve a score high enough to continue to N.E.W.T.-level (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test) for the class in the remaining two years. Some classes, including the core classes, may be dropped in sixth year. Specialised classes such as Alchemy become available in sixth year provided there is sufficient demand.</p>

    <h3>Astronomy</h3>
    <p>
        Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that has a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes. Lessons were held every week at midnight, and first years had lessons on Wednesday. Known student homework activities included learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments.[4]

       <div class="col">
<h3>Charms</h3>
    <p>Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consists on learning those sorts of spells. Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical.[12]

<h3>Defence&#160;&#160; Against&#160;&#160; the&#160;&#160; Dark&#160;&#160; Arts</h3>
    <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.

        The subject had an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members — throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has remained at Hogwarts for more than one school year. These included Quirinus Quirrell,[13] Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Bartemius Crouch Jnr impersonating Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow</p>
