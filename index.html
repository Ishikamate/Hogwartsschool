    <p>There were a variety of subjects taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. These included both the core curriculum and the electives, available from third year forward. In the fifth year, students take the Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) exams to determine whether they can achieve a score high enough to continue to N.E.W.T.-level (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test) for the class in the remaining two years. Some classes, including the core classes, may be dropped in sixth year. Specialised classes such as Alchemy become available in sixth year provided there is sufficient demand.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <h3>Astronomy</h3>
    <p>
        Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that has a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes. Lessons were held every week at midnight, and first years had lessons on Wednesday. Known student homework activities included learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments.[4]
       </p></div>
       <div class="col">
<h3>Charms</h3>
    <p>Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consists on learning those sorts of spells. Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical.[12]

       </p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h3>Defence&#160;&#160; Against&#160;&#160; the&#160;&#160; Dark&#160;&#160; Arts</h3>
    <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.

        The subject had an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members — throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has remained at Hogwarts for more than one school year. These included Quirinus Quirrell,[13] Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Bartemius Crouch Jnr impersonating Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow</p>

           <div class="col">
            <h3>Slytherin</h3>
                <p>Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin.[1] In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Ravenclaw</h3>
                    <p>Ravenclaw values intelligence, learning, wisdom and wit.[HP5][HP7] The house mascot is an eagle and the house colours are
                         blue and bronze (blue and silver in the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films and on the ties and scarves). During the 
                         books, the head of this house is the Charms teacher, Professor Filius Flitwick, and the house ghost is the Grey Lady. 
                          </p>
                    </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h3>Gryffindor</h3>
            <p>
                Gryffindor values bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Its emblematic animal is the lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold.
                 Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick",
                  was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponds to the element of Fire.
                   
               </p></div>
               <div class="col">
                <h3>Hufflepuff</h3>
                    <p>Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black
                         (or golden yellow and graphite in the Fantastic Beasts films) are its colours. During the books, the Head of this house 
                         is the Herbology Professor Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is the Fat Friar. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff
                          corresponds roughly to the element of earth. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff.
